## About me
<p>My name is Derek Zhang and I am a junior computer science student at the University of Kansas. I have a passion for technology and a drive to learn and grow in the field. My previous experience includes working as a software engineer intern for Cboe Global Markets, where I had the opportunity to work on C++ programs for real-time systems. Additionally, I have also run my own company, <a href="https://www.datablu.net">DataBlu LLC</a>, which specialized in creating custom software for small businesses.

I am also actively involved in IEEE and have participated in various projects with my team. Last year, we built an LED cube and this year we are currently building a quadcopter. I am also proud to have participated in HackKU, my University's Hackathon, where we built a web app that utilized Google Cloud OCR to parse and transcribe text and images from textbooks and writing on whiteboards.

I am most comfortable with programming in Python and C++, but I have experience with many other languages such as JavaScript, Go, and SQL. My goal is to continue to expand my knowledge and skills in the field and I am planning on pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in artificial intelligence or machine learning in the future. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
