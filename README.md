## About me
<p>Hi, I'm Derek Zhang, a software professional with a diverse background in software development and engineering. My experience spans a variety of areas, including software engineering, system engineering, and robotics. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Kansas and am currently pursuing a Master's at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I'm further expanding my technical knowledge.

Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects and internships that have honed my skills in problem-solving and innovation. For example, at Indra Air Traffic, I developed models to streamline system evaluations, and at GE HealthCare, I contributed to optimizing imaging processes. These experiences have deepened my understanding of how technology can be applied to solve complex challenges.

Beyond my professional roles, I've also led and contributed to various projects, from analyzing data for aerospace design competitions to developing software solutions for real-world applications. I enjoy tackling new challenges and bringing projects to successful completion.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in several programming languages and tools, including Python and C++, and I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive progress in various domains.

I'm always open to connecting with others and exploring opportunities where I can apply my skills and experience to make an impact. Feel free to reach out if you think there might be a good fit.</p>
