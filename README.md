## About me
<p>Hi, I'm Derek Zhang, a software professional with a solid background in AI and machine learning. I have a special interest in computer vision and AI, but my passion spans many areas, including system engineering, robotics, and quantitative analysis. My educational journey has taken me from a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Kansas to pursuing a Master's at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I'm deepening my knowledge.

In my professional experience, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and internships. At Indra Air Traffic, I developed AI models to streamline system evaluations, and at GE HealthCare, I worked on deep learning models for MRI imaging. These roles have given me practical insights into applying advanced technologies to solve real-world problems.

I've also contributed to and led several projects outside of my internships. From analyzing data for aerospace design competitions to developing computer vision models for detecting parking spots, I enjoy tackling challenges and seeing projects through to completion.

My technical skills span across various programming languages and tools, including Python and C++. I am particularly interested in how AI can be used to enhance systems engineering and robotics.

I'm always open to job opportunities where I can leverage my expertise in AI, machine learning, and computer vision. Feel free to connect if you think my skills and experience align with what you're looking for.</p>
