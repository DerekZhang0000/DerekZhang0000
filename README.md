## About me
<p>Hi, I'm Derek Zhang, a software professional with a diverse background in software development, system engineering, and AI. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Kansas and am currently pursuing a Master's at the University of Colorado Boulder to further expand my technical knowledge.

Currently, I’m a Software Engineer at Tyler Technologies, where I enhance mission-critical Java applications and collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful solutions. My work includes optimizing backend performance with SQL and integrating third-party APIs to streamline system functionality.

Throughout my career, I've taken on a variety of challenges, from improving system evaluations for air traffic management at Indra Air Traffic, to contributing to medical imaging technology at GE HealthCare. These roles have deepened my understanding of how to apply technology to solve complex problems across different industries.

Beyond my professional roles, I’ve led and contributed to several projects, including data analysis for aerospace design competitions and software development for real-world applications. My technical expertise spans Python, C++, and other programming languages and tools, and I am passionate about driving innovation in diverse domains.

I’m always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and exploring opportunities where I can apply my skills to make an impact. Feel free to reach out!</p>
