## About me
<p>I'm Derek Zhang, a machine learning and software development specialist studying computer science at the University of Kansas. I have experience in developing Python-based deep learning models at GE HealthCare for predicting MRI reconstruction time. I co-founded DataBlu, where I created custom software for small businesses. At Cboe Global Markets, I programmed real-time market exchanges. Additionally, I conducted research on variable relationships in disaster recovery. I possess skills in Python, C/C++, and machine learning libraries including PyTorch and Tensorflow. I am always eager to collaborate and tackle new challenges.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I actively engage in extracurricular activities. At Jayhawk Aero Design, I contribute to the Data Science and Intelligence Team, analyzing aircraft airspeed statistics for design decisions in the AIAA Design/Build/Fly competition. I developed an adaptive MATLAB application to optimize flight strategy based on competitor performance. In KUbeSat, I'm a member of the Software Team, developing Python software for inter-payload communication between the KUbeSat1 satellite and the ground station. These experiences have enriched my academic journey, providing practical applications of data analysis and engineering principles. I'm grateful for the collaborative and innovative learning opportunities these activities offer.</p>
